# 3 Sector Antenna Pattern

This program will help you estimate coverage side lobe overlapping for 3 sector base station implementation based on selected antenna pattern and azimuth.

### Explanation
Mass base station implementation usually applying a sectorization concept where each antenna will cover a certain range of area based on transmitted power. This concept is to allow some sort of control for every resource transmitted within the antenna radiation pattern. However, this implementation will get a little bit tricky when it comes to antenna radiation overlapping.

<br />
Antenna radiation overlapping will cause interference for coverage and traffic if it is not handled well in RF planning. This program will help to visualize overlapping condition based on your selected antenna pattern and planned azimuth for your antenna.
